File Structure:

	/templates (this folder contains all html files)
		- main.html
		- insert.html
		- query.html

Instructions:
- I am trying to host it and will send out the link if I am able to achieve it but I just wanted to make the code submission on time. In any case, please take the following steps in order to evaluate my code:
1. Run “python bib.py”
2. Go to localhost:8000 to check out the website
Also, the website is not foolproof. It does all the basic steps but error handling is a little weak.
